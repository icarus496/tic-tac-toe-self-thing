	
	1. Make a console based tic-tac-toe game 
	2. Make two dictionaries that map game state to a list of potential moves (that are sorted by probability of a good outcome) --> (dictionary? https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/datastructures.html)
	3. Make two bots to play it
		Bot actions:
			1. check current game state
			2. search the list for game states, select the one with the highest win rate, play it, append it to temporary move list
			3. Nothing in list? Move random, append move to the temporary list
			4. At the end of the game, add the list of moves to the dictionary of possible moves with win rates (if new) or change win rate of existing moves (if not)
